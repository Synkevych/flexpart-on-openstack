FLEXPART (“FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model”) is a Lagrangian transport and dispersion model suitable for the simulation of a large range of atmospheric
transport processes. Apart from transport and turbulent diffusion, it is able to simulate dry and wet deposition, decay, linear chemistry;  
it can be used in forward or backward mode, with defined sources or in a domain-filling setting. It can be used from local to global scale.
